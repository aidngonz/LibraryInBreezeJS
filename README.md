# Written in Breeze.js 1.2.0
### Description:

Breeze.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework designed for simplified web development, focusing on DOM manipulation and state management. With a minimalist approach, it offers essential functionalities such as creating DOM elements (`newElement`), managing document layers (`Layer`), handling application state (`State`), create forms and collect form data (`Form `), and utility functions (`Helpers`) to streamline development tasks.

### Use Cases:

Breeze.js is ideal for developers looking to build responsive and interactive web applications efficiently. Use cases include:

- Dynamic UI Creation: Easily generate and manipulate DOM elements to dynamically update user interfaces based on data changes.

- Layered Application Structure: Manage complex application layouts with layered elements (`Layer`), facilitating organized and visually distinct components.

- State Management: Maintain application state (`State`) across components, enabling synchronized updates and efficient data handling.

- Utility Functions: Simplify common DOM operations (`Helpers`), such as element creation, attribute setting, and event handling, enhancing developer productivity.
